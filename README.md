This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing a book library. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and follows the steps outlined in the YouTube tutorial: [Introduction to the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA).

## Project Contents

This project is an introductory example of how to build a full-stack application using the MERN stack. It covers creating a backend server with Node.js and Express, connecting to a MongoDB database, and building a frontend interface with React to perform CRUD operations on a book library.

The tutorial is divided into two main sections:
1. **Backend Development**: Setting up the server, creating API routes, and connecting to MongoDB.
2. **Frontend Development**: Creating the React application to display and interact with the data.

## Features

Create: Add new books to the library.
Read: View a list of all books.
Update: Edit details of existing books.
Delete: Remove books from the library.
